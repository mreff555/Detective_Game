# Detective Game
Never say I wasn't creative at naming things!  Yeah, this is an attempt at making a very simple game.  Sort of Myst style but detective themed.  There was a Nintendo game in the 90's called Deja Vu, which I probably took some of the ideas from.  Not sure what I am going to do with it.  I'm honestly not all that creative, this is my attempt at messing with a graphics library.  Largely un-explored territory in the past, so we will see what happens.
